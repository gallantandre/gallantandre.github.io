![Robot Lifting a Weight]({{ "assets/images/weight-large.jpg" | relative_url }})

In the first major part of my thesis, I looked at how to use the dynamics of a robot to enable it to lift heavy objects. The idea is that sometimes, robots are not strong enough to lift a heavy object through shear brute force. In such cases I showed that, if we have the robot move a little more intelligently, we can greatly increase its capacity. These results were validated on a simple robot prototype I designed.

In the second major part of my Ph.D., I explored methods of using robot kinematics, dynamics, and trajectory optimization to throw objects. The first goal was to throw objects the furthest possible and the next part was to hit a precise target.

During my Ph.D. work, I also got the opportunity to teach the Rigid Body Dynamics course at the undergraduate level. With 160 students, this was a trial by fire exercise that I thoroughly enjoyed and that confirmed my passion for learning and teaching.

Finally, I had an undergraduate intern work with me to explore a few different avenues that I would not have had time to dive into on my own. This project, over two summers and part-time for one year, helped hone my project management skills and structure my Ph.D. project a little better.
